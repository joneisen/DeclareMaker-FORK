#DeclareMaker
A small project which parses Apple Documentation html files into Xojo classes.

##How to use
Download the documentation of a class as html.  This can be done with Option-Return in Safari.  Then drag the downloaded file into the Green drop area in the DeclareMaker window.  The name of the class should appear in the Listbox to the right of the drop zone.  You may keep dropping new files (or a batch of files) to add them to the list.  When you are ready to export them as a Xojo project file, click Save and select a location to save the file.  You can clear the list of classes which will be generated by clicking on the "C" button in the top right of the window.

Please feel free to modify and improve this project.  If you think you have changes that everyone should enjoy please submit them to be merged.
